PLEASE READ DETAILS OF THE FILES INCLUDED IN FOLDER: 

1.  util.py            -  Library requirements.
2.  dataGeneration.py  -  Code for generation of the synthetic datasets 1 and 2.
3.  Algorithms.py      -  Code for baseline algorithms and proposed algorithms (OPLP_Query and BFLP-Query)
4.  main.py            -  Driver file.
5.  plots.py           -  Code for plot generation. (nDCG@25 vs Algorithms , PredictRank vs. TrueRank)
6.  Datasets           -  contains three data files. Two synthetic datasets and one real-world MIT data.



How to RUN the CODE - 

1. Install the requirements mentioned in util.py
2. Connect to CUDA(GPU)
3. Run the main.py file.
4. As prompted enter dataset to be used to test algorithms. (sd1 or sd2 or MIT)
            - enter "sd1" for synthetic dataset 1
            - enter "sd2" for synthetic dataset 2
            - enter "MIT" for MIT DATA
5. Code will run on all the baselines and proposed algorithms.
            (Call for algorithms starts from lineNo:35 (main.py) and ends at lineNo:73 (main.py).
            - To test individual baselines/Algorithms Comment other algorithms calls. 
              start of the algorithm call indicated by comment on right side in main.py(lineno: 35 to 73)

6. To plot the results - 
            - Run all the baseline and proposed algorithms.(Uncomment lineNo 35 to 73 (main.py))
            Plot 1 -  Uncomment LineNo-77 (main.py): Will give plot for nDCG@25 vs Algorithms
            Plot 2 -  Uncomment LineNo - 78,79,80 (main.py) Replace the ALGORITHM_NAME
                      with one mentioned in comment on line 79 (main.py) in prPath
                      (This will generate plot for Predictrank vs Truerank)
